Applications where the tool can be used
========================================

Currently the tools covers a limited range of situations that can be handled, these are:

* The :ref:`qdref` can only be applied on S5P qdoas output. Only Slant columns from absorbers such as HCHO,SO2,BrO,NO2,C2H2O2 are currently implemented. More molecules can easily be added.  
* The :ref:`auxref` can for the moment only fetch auxiliary data from an operational S5P HCHO L2 datafile. More Extensions will be implemented soon.
