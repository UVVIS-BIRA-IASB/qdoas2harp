Qdoas to Harp Variables
=======================

The aim of the qdoas2harp tool is to facilitate the post processing of a qdoas file. Many functionalities of HARP can be used on such a harp compliant output format. One very useful scenario is when
one want to do some gridding on a qdoas file. Moreover many L2 formats can already be converted to such a Harp format.  Also, the BeAMF tool assumes that an input file is in the Harp format.
Below in picture :numref:`qdoasview`  a typical qdoas layout is shown.
