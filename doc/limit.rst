Field of application
=====================

Currently the tools covers a limited range of situations that can be handled, these are:

* The :ref:`qdref` can only be applied on S5P qdoas output. Only Slant columns from absorbers such as HCHO,SO2,BrO,NO2,C2H2O2 are currently implemented. 
* The :ref:`auxref` for HCHO, and if an operational S5P HCHO L2 datafile is available from which the auxiliary information can be fetched.
